1- Grab the bottom plate and place it on the assembly bench.
2- Grab the spacers and place them upon the bottom plate. 
3- Grab the upper plate and place it on the spacers.
4- Grab the M3 screws and nuts and install them. 

And this is how a single cycle of assembly works.
This is the final robotic manipulator.
